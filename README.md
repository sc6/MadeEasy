<h2>MadeEasy</h2>

<h4>A project by Steve Chang and Aditya Aggarwal</h4>

MadeEasy was what we worked on for the first ever SDhacks, a hackathon based in San Diego. The idea of this project was to create a new way to learn and teach. We thought interactivity was key in learning, and so we decided to go with a powerpoint idea which features user interaction with the slides.

We strived to make the UI as good looking as possible, which meant clean and easy-to-use for the user.

This project involved the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
